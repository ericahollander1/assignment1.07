Title: HW 1.07

Description:
This program is the seventh step in creating a functional rogue like game. This 
step was specifically used to implement a characteristic functionality for the 
non player characters and objects. We were allowed to only do one of them given 
the fact that they are both very similar processes so we only did the monster 
file. This takes in a file that has the different characteristics of the monsters 
set by headings and stores it into a struct that we created. There is also a 
"dice" struct that stores the characteristics that need a roll to be stored and 
displayed in the form <base>+<num_die>d<sides>. Then later after reading through 
all of the file it displays the final output of each monsters characteristics to 
the screen in the correct order and formatting. 
 
 
Technologies used:
 We used CLion to write in C++. For the final test we used emaca on Ubuntu to see it on 
 the console. The two txt files were both done on Eclipse.
